## Snapshots, Not Differences
Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.

* You can interact with GitHub via SSH or HTTP. SSH is the preferred method because it is more secure than the tokens that would be generated by the HTTP method.
* Create an SSH key and Publish on GitHub account

## Special Files

<details><summary><b>CODEOWNERS</b></summary>
A CODEOWNERS file is a file used in GitHub to define who the owners or maintainers of a particular set of files or directories are. It is used for code review and to manage pull requests by assigning reviewers and approvers automatically.
 
After the CODEOWNERS file is created, GitHub will use it to automatically assign code review requests to the owners or maintainers specified in the file. This can help streamline the code review process and ensure that the right people are reviewing and approving changes to the codebase.

</details>
  
<details><summary><b>.gitignore </b></summary>
A .gitignore file is a text file used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git when committing changes to a repository. This is useful for preventing certain files, such as build artifacts or temporary files, from being included in a commit.
 
After the .gitignore file is created, Git will automatically ignore the files and directories specified in the file when committing changes to the repository. This can help keep the repository clean and organized, and prevent unnecessary files from cluttering the commit history.

<details><summary><b>LICENSE </b></summary>
A LICENSE file in a GitHub repository is a file that outlines the terms and conditions under which the software in the repository can be used, modified, and distributed. It is an important aspect of open-source software development because it clarifies the legal rights and responsibilities of users and contributors.
 
By adding a license file to your GitHub repository, you are communicating to users and contributors how they can legally use and contribute to your project. It also helps to protect your work and ensure that your contributions are properly credited.
