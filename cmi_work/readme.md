To build the audience propensity model, we need a comprehensive dataset at the user level that captures purchase history. This includes not only transactional data but also details about the products they buy, the attributes of these products, demographic information, and the profiles of the stores they visit. The dataset should cover a sufficient time period to enable accurate predictions about future purchases. In this case, we use at least one year of data to capture patterns over 12 months.


From this model, we extract valuable insights and features to understand the driving factors behind purchases, product affinity, and basket economics. These insights help us to comprehend what influences customer behavior and preferences.

For customer data, we use Fetch as our primary source, which acts as first-party proxy data. Additionally, we incorporate data from Nielsen's source to extract product attributes and taxonomy which provides a holistic view of the products and their characteristics.

We also leverage the Opportunity Cluster data, which lists the claims associated with each product. This information is crucial in building a comprehensive audience 360 view by understanding the role of attributes like calorie consciousness, heart health, and allergens,etc in shaping customer food choices.
